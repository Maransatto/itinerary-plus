# Itinerary Plus (NestJS)

Contract-first API to sort travel tickets into a complete itinerary and render a human-readable version.

## Mock the API (no backend needed)

You can mock the endpoints from the OpenAPI contract immediately.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18

### Using Prism (recommended)

1. Install Prism CLI (globally or via npx):

   ```bash
   npx @stoplight/prism-cli@5 mock openapi.yaml
   ```

2. Prism will start a mock server (default on `http://127.0.0.1:4010`).

3. Try the examples:
   - Create itinerary (201)

     ```bash
     curl -i \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -H "Idempotency-Key: demo-123" \
       --data @examples/create-itinerary-request.json \
       http://127.0.0.1:4010/v1/itineraries
     ```

   - Retrieve by id (200 JSON)

     ```bash
     curl -i http://127.0.0.1:4010/v1/itineraries/5b4cc1f8-6e2b-43a2-9c19-2d83f7b16f5b
     ```

   - Retrieve human-readable (text/plain)

     ```bash
     curl -i -H "Accept: text/plain" http://127.0.0.1:4010/v1/itineraries/5b4cc1f8-6e2b-43a2-9c19-2d83f7b16f5b
     ```

   - Example business error (422)
     ```bash
     curl -i \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --data @examples/error-422.json \
       http://127.0.0.1:4010/v1/itineraries
     ```

### Notes

- Spec version: OpenAPI 3.1.0 (`openapi.yaml`).
- No authentication in v1.
- Status codes: 201 (create), 200 (get), 400, 404, 409, 422, 500.
- Extensible tickets via `type` discriminator: train, tram, bus, boat, flight, taxi.

## Postman import note

Postman may show ‚ÄúToo many levels of nesting to fake this schema‚Äù when importing OpenAPI 3.1 with `oneOf` + `allOf` inheritance.

Workarounds:

- Prefer Swagger UI or Prism for mocking.
- Or switch the spec to OpenAPI 3.0.3 and reduce `allOf` depth (e.g., avoid `ItineraryItem` inheriting from `Ticket`).
- Or keep the spec as-is and rely on the concrete JSON examples in `examples/` for Postman requests.

## Development Progress

This project follows a contract-first approach with systematic layered development:

### Phase 1: Contract & API Design ‚úÖ

- **DTOs and Entities**: Created comprehensive data transfer objects and entity models for tickets, places, and itineraries
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Defined complete API contract in `openapi.yaml` with proper validation schemas
- **Swagger Integration**: Set up Swagger UI for API documentation and testing
- **Mock Samples**: Provided JSON examples in `examples/` directory to support other teams for mocking and testing

### Phase 2: Database Layer üöß (Current)

- **Docker Setup**: Created containerized PostgreSQL database environment
- **TypeORM Integration**: Configured TypeORM with proper entity relationships and migrations
- **Entity Refinement**: Adjusted previously created entities to work with database constraints and relationships

#### Database Setup

1. **Start the PostgreSQL database**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - **Host**: localhost
   - **Port**: 5433 (to avoid conflicts with existing PostgreSQL installations)
   - **Database**: itinerary_plus
   - **Username**: kevin
   - **Password**: mcallister2024

3. **Verify database is running**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Access database directly** (if needed):

   ```bash
   docker exec -it itinerary-plus-db psql -U kevin -d itinerary_plus
   ```

5. **Stop database**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Phase 3: Service Layer (Upcoming)

- **Service Implementation**: Create service layer with initial mocked logic for business operations
- **Repository Integration**: Implement repositories to handle database operations through TypeORM
- **Data Persistence**: Connect services to repositories for actual database interactions

### Phase 4: Controller Layer (Upcoming)

- **Controller Implementation**: Wire up NestJS controllers to use the service layer
- **Request/Response Handling**: Implement proper HTTP handling with validation and error responses
- **API Contract Compliance**: Ensure controllers match the OpenAPI specification

### Phase 5: Testing Layer (Upcoming)

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive Jest test coverage for services and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for API endpoints
- **Test Data**: Create fixtures and test scenarios

### Database Design Notes

The current implementation creates a simplified data model where the `create itinerary` endpoint will:

- **Auto-create places and tickets**: If places or tickets don't exist in the database, they will be created automatically
- **Accept some redundancy**: Initially, tickets may contain duplicate information (e.g., multiple flight tickets for the same flight but different seats)

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**

- **Granular flight data**: Extract shared flight information (airline, flight number, departure time, aircraft type) into a separate `Flight` entity
- **Train service normalization**: Create a `TrainService` entity with train number, route, operator, and schedule that multiple train tickets can reference
- **Bus route optimization**: Implement `BusRoute` entities containing service number, operator, and route details shared across multiple bus tickets
- **Boat/Ferry services**: Extract vessel information, operator, and route into reusable `BoatService` entities
- **Transportation hubs**: Create `TransportationHub` entities for airports, train stations, and bus terminals with detailed facility information
- **Ticket normalization**: Create relationships where multiple tickets can reference the same underlying transportation service
- **Optimized storage**: Reduce data duplication by normalizing transportation services and shared infrastructure

_Note: The granular normalization is not in scope for the current implementation, prioritizing rapid development and API functionality._

## Next Steps (implementation)

- Complete TypeORM entity relationships and migrations
- Implement service layer with sorting algorithm
- Wire up controllers with proper validation
